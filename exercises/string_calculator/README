Create a simple calculator method, called 'add'.
================================================

[NOTE]: The solution can be found in ./solutions/string_calculator.

It takes a string consisting of 0, 1, or 2 numbers and returns the sum.
For an empty string it returns 0.

* Start with an empty string and move to one and then two numbers.

* Allow the method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.

* Allow new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
  - The following input is ok: "1\n2,3" (will equal 6).
  - The following input is NOT ok: "1,\n2".

* Allow optional custom delimiters. The beginning of the string will contain a
  separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]".
  For example, "//;\n1;2" should return 3 where the delimiter is ‘;’.

* Calling 'add' with a negative number should throw an exception with a
  "negatives not allowed" message and the negatives that were passed.
